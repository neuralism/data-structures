# Personal Notes

### Purpose of the program
Grab the HTML content of ten files from 'http://visualizedata.github.io/datastructures/data/' and write them into my 'local' environment in Cloud9 as TXT files.

### What is Node.js and how does it work?
- Node.js is a JavaScript runtime written in C++ that enables me to run JavaScript code on the server or my computer instead of just the browser.
- A runtime is basically the code that runs the JavaScript code (or compiles it into machine code) and is usually written in a low-level language like C++ or C.
- The lower the level the language the closer it is to machine code (code used by the hardware like binary code) and the higher the level the language the more abstracted it is from machine code.
- Node.js uses the same engine as Chrome to run JavaScript code. The engine is called V8 and it is bulit by Google.
- One of the features of Node.js is that it supports asynchronous or non-blocking I/O (input/output).
- Node.js comes with several built-in modules (modules are units of functionality you can load into your program) that allow you to write files and create servers.
- It also comes with NPM (Node Package Manager) which is a command line tool that lets you access to an online repository of packages containing modules.
