## Personal Notes

#### Purpose of the Program
Grab the HTML content of ten files from 'http://visualizedata.github.io/datastructures/data/' and write them into my 'local' environment in Cloud9 as TXT files.

#### What is Node.js and how does it work?
- Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that enables me to run JavaScript code on the server or my computer instead of just the browser.
- A runtime is basically the code that runs the (JavaScript) code and it is typically written a lower-level language like C++ or C. Node.js is written in C++. 
- The lower the level the language the closer it is to machine language; which is the code used by the hardware, such as binary code. In contrast, the higher the level the language the more abstracted it is from machine language; which in this case, is JavaScript.
- Node.js uses the same JavaScript engine as Chrome browsers to run JavaScript code. The engine is called Chrome V8 and it is built by Google.
